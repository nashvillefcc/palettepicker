# The Palette Picker™
 
This tool is a page that shows a generic/example web page in a preview window and allows the user to select colors for the different HTML elements on that example page. The aim of this tool is to help users choose a desired palette of colors for use on their own website layout, and give the user the hex or rgb values of those colors to be easily plugged into CSS.
