# The Palette Picker™

## Phase 1 complete!

---

This tool is a page that shows a generic/example web page in a preview window and allows the user to select colors for the different HTML elements on that example page. The aim of this tool is to help users choose a desired palette of colors for use on their own website layout, and give the user the hex or rgb values of those colors to be easily plugged into CSS.

This is a project built by members of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-Nashville/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp Nashville Meetup group</a>

To run this project, make sure you have installed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node</a> and run the following in the terminal:

> `npm install`

Once the packages have finished installing, run

> `npm start`

from the root directory.

This will start the app.

## TODO / Phase 2:

- Implement Material-UI to make it look snazzy

- Going forward, I would like to add sign-up/login functionality, as well as the ability for a user to save their selected colors

- I would like to make the preview pane modular/customizable. Either give the user the option to look at 3 or 4 different preview layouts (including mobile), or the ability to customize the preview layout by adding/removing, resizing, and moving elements
